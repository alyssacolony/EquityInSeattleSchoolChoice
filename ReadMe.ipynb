    "## Abstract:\n",
    "With the advent of Donald Trump's appointment of Betsy Devos, a long-time school choice advocate as the Secretary of Education, there is a national effort to increase access to school choice. Proponents of this system believe that students benefit from being able to choose the school that best meets their individual needs, which results in better achievement and attainment. Opponents of this system are concerned that it benefits only a certain group of students, while leaving out groups of marginalized students resulting in increased segregation and worse outcomes for some students, This paper investigates Seattle's school choice system and addresses the following questions: \n",
    "- **1.** Do Seattle's Choice schools serve all student groups equally?  \n",
    "- **2a.** Does the admission prioritization system benefit student in the geozone to the detriment of children outside the geozone?  \n",
    "- **2b.** Do admissions prioritization based on geozone disproportionately benefit any group of students?  \n",
    "- **3.** Do students who attend Choice Schools perform better than their peers who attend attendance area schools (as measured by standardized testing conducted by the state)?  \n",
    "\n",
    "We find that Seattle's school choice system disproportionately serves White students and Native American Students, while under-serving black, Hispanic, Asian and Low income students. We also find that the admission system favors white students because white students disproportionately live in the geozone areas. Finally, we find that there is mixed results on whether choice schools increase student' achievement. For students overall there is not a significant difference between achievement at choice schools vs attendance area schools. However, Hispanic students had higher rates of achievement at choice schools, while black and white students had higher rates of achievement at attendance area schools. The disproportionate access of white students to choice schools may warrant advocacy for a policy change in Seattle's school choice admission process. The achievement rates at choice and attendance area schools warrants more study. "
